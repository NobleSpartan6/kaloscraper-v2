3
0:00:11,000 --> 0:00:34,000
this one I've also been focused on Stitch this week so I would love to open this and if we have time I would love to open one of these we just purchased them together a Hot Topic um this one we have a lot of work to do first up is Stitch we've never opened one of these before and I assume we just need to remove this plastic

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with scissors so now it looks like this a little spaceship and I don't know if it's wrapped inside so let's look together

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:52,000
oh it's not it's in clear plastic I'm hiding it from us people work making it out of the plastic look with me we got

6
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:54,000
oh angel

7
0:00:54,000 --> 0:01:36,000
oh that's cute is she like blowing a kiss I guess I should see what else is in the spaceship it is a little sticker I guess you get a matching sticker okay that's fun and then something here little little stickers of some kind probably to decorate your little spaceship okay that was fun up next let's do Pride I don't like to look at the packaging too much but I did want to let you know it's the Disney Pride collection and it's a figural bag clip and I'm pretty certain yes these always require scissors could you imagine if we got Stitch or Ursula how fun would that be okay I'm unwrapping it and look with me

8
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
oh this this spoon the spork oh okay okay how stinking cute is that I am not disappointed at all I can't wait to get it on my pocketbook
