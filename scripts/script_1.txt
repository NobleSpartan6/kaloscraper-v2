for a 12 pack now we set it up this way because customers were paying 13.99 for shipping and most places across the country and I for one thought our customers deserve better we moved our business over to fulfilled by tiktok which in the long run this will be a great move that being said in the short-term it was a bit of a struggle because customers prices were 13.99 free shipping our customers were stuck paying for it even though competitors customers weren't so I provided the 1399 discount to make sure that shipping was covered because our normal price is 30 dollars so let's say for example you picked up our case at 16 bucks and then you added to 1399 that's two dollars and fifty cents
