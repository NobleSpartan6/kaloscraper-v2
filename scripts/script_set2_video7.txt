0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,000
so I went to a seminar on Barbara O'Neill a couple weeks ago and it has completely changed my life and I wanted to share some of the things that I learned with you guys even though I'm a health coach I've been studying herbs for well over a decade

2
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:19,000
there was still so much knowledge that she had that really clarified a lot of things for me

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and unless you've been living under a rock you know who she is

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a lot of good information in her book

5
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but one thing that got crazy on tiktok last year was trying to get Celtic Sea salt because Barbara talked about how

6
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we really don't get the minerals that our body needs through regular table salt and most of the foods that we because all of our soil is so deficient and in

7
0:00:46,000 --> 0:01:30,000
minerals now so ever since she started talking about that it's been really hard to get Celtic Sea salt plus it's pretty darn expensive and recently a study came out by lead safe Mama that talked about that there are fairly high levels of lead in the popular Celtic Sea salt Brands so I really wanted an alternative so I actually asked Barbara about it and she actually told everyone that if you can find the Baja gold salt that it is just as good and actually better than the Celtic Sea salt so the Baja gold saw actually has less of the sodium in it and more minerals than the Celtic Sea salt hat

8
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and she said that they're very similar and how they are harvested they're all hand harvested it's done in a very pristine clean way and all natural

9
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so what did I do I immediately

10
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:53,000
got some salt I will say that it's a little bit more of a damper

11
0:01:54,000 --> 0:02:22,000
kind of salt a little bit it doesn't work as well in a Shaker but I just sprinkle it on meals with my fingers and that works really well put a little bit under my tongue before I drink water like she said and that helps the Magnesium that's in the salt helps the water actually get into our cells as we drink so you're getting better hydration it also makes food taste even better which is

12
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:35,000
something really cool that happened and one of my favorite things about it is you get so much more for your money so by weight it is much cheaper than the Celtic Sea salt Plus

13
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the lead situation is an issue so you guys check this out actually found it cheaper on tiktok shop and if you've never shopped Tick Tock shop before there's a 30% off coupon so check this stuff out it's awesome and it's Barbara O'Neill approved
