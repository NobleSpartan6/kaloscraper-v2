0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:02,000
I did not plan ahead for this

2
0:00:02,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but then I thought this is a good test just because pork prior planning can turn into a learning experience for everyone you guys know I've tried these before and we liked them but you wanted me to try quesadilla which is like the birria tacos you dip it in the sauce and it turns into something delicious and I've never had those so I thought today is a good day and I also thought I should have popped these in the slow cooker hours ago but now it is 4:00 I have almost three pounds of chuck roast and we are going to hold this is all gonna be done by the time dinner comes around if not this video won't happen Chuck rows into your pressure cooker we're going to see if you can pressure cook your beer bomb oh apparently you can the package instructions you can put these in a pressure cooker we are in Loch Berry bomb going in right on top I'm supposed to cut up my chuck roast I am not doing that I'm not chunking anything up that sounds like work to me I'm also not searing anything oh so sounds like work where to use two cups of water because I'm a rebel

3
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:10,000
and I know some of you guys said you need to be using beef broth I don't have beef broth and I don't feel like maybe I have a bullying Cube I

4
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:20,000
and I know some of you guys said you need to be using beef broth I don't have beef broth and I don't feel like maybe I have a bouillon Cube I don't have a bullying Cube handy so we're just going with this we are going to trust that the beer bomb is flavorful enough to give us a beerus sauce and also flavorful meat half the living room

5
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and we are going to go on high pressure for

6
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:40,000
70 80 minutes and let it naturally release and hopefully we'll be able to make dinner right then and there like that sometime has elapsed and this should be done it is released pressure oh no my beer bomb I'm not sure if you can see

7
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is sitting on top I think that's probably why they want you to chunk it up when you put it in the car here's what we're going to do we are going to smash this beer about them

8
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we are going to

9
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
stir it around

10
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as we're doing this

11
0:01:53,000 --> 0:02:03,000
my beef is shredding up nice it'll it'll all come together it's not the end of the world I probably should have followed the instructions be better than me don't be like me I'm sure it's going to be delicious

12
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:22,000
smells phenomenal still I don't think that it's going to affect it much but we'll be back tomorrow when it is time to assemble it is now the next day and our beer beef has been sitting in the fridge overnight that's fat it's fine don't worry about it you're going to put this into a pot like so

13
0:02:23,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you may remember that I only use two cups of liquid last time because I wanted it to be a little bit more potent it was a little maybe two potent I think and while this is heating up I need to do some dishes or else we're not gonna be able to do this because I'm not doing it on the Blackstone night because it's been raining off and on and I don't want to be stuck out in the rain with a whole bunch of moot mood oh a whole bunch food the dishes are mostly done and I am sufficiently sweaty let's make dinner I have here my area beef and it's sauce and I'm going to take the meat and put it into the bowl this is not offensive this is just because house we are just doing the best that we can with what we have and what we have is a very bomb and it smells so good and it's gonna taste so good

0:02:23,000 --> 0:03:19,000

15
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I want to do my pants which probably could be hotter

16
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:26,000
some cheese

17
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:28,000
like so

18
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:29,000
some beef

19
0:03:30,000 --> 0:04:24,000
also like so usually we are a flour tortilla family but this calls for corn tortillas this is not like there's no option here this is not something that my kids would be interested in this is too spicy for my kids not in the sense of heat because this beer bomb is not spicy at all it is flavorful spice but they're children and it's different and I'll definitely put some of the beef on their plate to try queera tacos made with easy beer bounce and I know what you're thinking is it even good and I'm thinking the same thing because I've never made this this way before but I do know that we love the easy Berry bomb so let's give them a taste and I'll let you know what I think I'm gonna dip mine in sour cream I know you're supposed to dip it in the area sauce but I feel like they're already soggy enough for like Saucy enough but I am going to squirt some lime on it they're really hot it's really hot and I want to try it for you so I'm going to use a fork
