0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is 9:00 in the morning and I have birria bombs everybody wants to know are these worth it so I purchased them with my own money and we are going to find out if these are worth it if they're delicious if they're all the things that everybody says they are and I think we're going to do bury a nachos for dinner tonight or Berea quesadillas I haven't decided yet it's nine in the morning I don't need to make these decisions yet let's start I have two and a third pound chuck roast

2
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:36,000
one to three pound chuck roast for this so we're on the right track here slow cooker

3
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:54,000
there was something inside we're already on a better start than we usually are because my meat's not frozen usually I am in a rush and I don't take out the meat ahead of time well I didn't freeze it today when it came home from the grocery store so we are going to throw it right into our slow cooker and get started

4
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:56,000
right in the bottom

5
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:12,000
now I'm all for like pre-made sauce situations so I'm not mad at getting a pre-made Spice Bomb if it's good because this is too meals worth well two roasts worth one beer bomb is what we're using

6
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:18,000
couldn't rip it too early in the morning to struggle so we're going to throw one bomb on top

7
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:20,000
they look just like this

8
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it smells good I'm gonna stick it right in the middle and then I need to add four cups of water two cups of water four cups of water now I don't usually follow instructions but since I'm testing something I guess I should it says slow cooker set to high let it work its magic for six hours low setting for eight hours Matthew do we have a showers before dinner or should I do it on high so I'll do it on high

9
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and then when we get to eight when we get to six hours I'll turn it down keep warm so I'm gonna pop the lid on this bitch and we're gonna

10
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:09,000
turn this on and then we'll come back when it's time to assemble dinner and see if it's actually worth it many hours have elapsed and our beeria beef situation smells phenomenal I cannot wait to eat this

11
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:33,000
oh my God it smells so good my house is smelled amazing all day let's shred this up and then we are going to do nachos because I don't feel like standing over the Blackstone today it's hot outside we've been at the pool all day that's why I look like this let's make some nachos yes that means I'm throwing them in the oven but it's only gonna be in the oven for a few minutes okay I think I'm going to pull it out and put it into a bowl and shut it up

12
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:34,000
oh my God it smells so good my house it smells amazing all day let's shred this up and then we are going to do nachos because I don't feel like standing over the Blackstone today it's hot outside we've been at the pool all day that's why I look like this let's make some nachos yes that means I'm throwing them in the oven but it's only gonna be in the oven for a few minutes okay I think I'm going to pull it out and put it in a bowl and Shred It Up

13
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:53,000
while I do this all also deck it because I don't want any icky bits my chuck roast is be it now we're not going to get rid of this beeria sauce that's in there because we want to rehydrate our beef a little bit we're going to use some of that to make it some moist if your beef does not shred this easily it's not cooked long enough

14
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I'm scooping the juice right onto my beef

15
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:00,000
like so sure everything is incorporated

16
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I'm gonna set it to the side while I start to build my Nacho's nachos are nothing revolutionary around here we have them off and you probably have them they're not authentic none of this is authentic I have no idea if the beer about is authentic we are just making dinner get off my back

17
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:25,000
well love cookie sheet unless you want to scrape burnt on cheese off we are going to do aluminum foil

18
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I'm spraying it down to ensure that nothing sticks I don't want sticky nachos well I do but not like that

19
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I'm spraying it down to ensure that nothing sticks I don't want sticky nachos well I do but not like that

20
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm not struggling today

21
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I'm not struggling today

22
0:03:36,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I am struggling today oh my gosh could I open this bag worse lay down your nachos just even layer now you may remember that I have children who live in this house who are certified picky asses so some of these are going to be cheese nachos some are going to be just beef nachos and some will have everything on it those will be mine in my husband he a cheese

23
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:21,000
something like that will do next up beef it is Saucy it smells phenomenal and I cannot wait to eat these seasoned black beans a little more cheese just on this side or tortilla chips am I teaching you how to make nachos apparently should you already know how to do this yeah

24
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it feels like a basic life skill that everyone should know how to do

25
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for the children because they don't like white cheese these into a 350 degree oven until they look done our Biryani Naturals are done let's give them a taste and see if that easy beer bomb is even worth it because I'm not sure if it's going to be good I have had mixed results I'm using Berea flavored things and I want to try this and see if I like it so let's give it a taste that's a big hunk of meat

26
0:04:52,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that's what she said I have guacamole I have black bean corn salsa and I have sour cream topped them with but for the taste test we're just gonna rot on it

27
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that beauty about is good if you are interested in me trying out the beer bomb to make burial like quesadilla tacos things let me know

28
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:20,000
and this is so good but of course it's good I made it follow along for more aggressive tutorials
