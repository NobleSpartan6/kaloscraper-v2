have you seen people that look like this on ozempic wigo V or Manjaro it happens to so many people they literally coined it ozempic face I've also heard that everybody's losing their and everybody's hair is falling up this happens because of extreme caloric deficit people are not meeting their protein goals number one not weight lifting number two have to strength train and eat protein to keep your muscle while losing your fat facts actually on week three of compounded Teresa tide and I understand now why people end up looking like that because appetite is gone so I know it's hard to eat and keep your protein goals up when you just don't feel like eating and everything kind of makes you nauseous I'm also very busy Avatar I'm on the go constantly so it's not realistic for me to meal prep every single meal all though I try works best for me and my lifestyle is on the go protein snacks that help me meet my goals every day so after seeing these all over tiktok shop well I hate and I got some and now I'm on my second box these have 19 grams of protein and 5 grams of collagen in each brownie they taste like actual brownies not gritty Sandy protein like those other

their cookies and bars that you find you can heat them up for 10-15 seconds in the microwave or put them in the freezer if you like a little Frozen sweet treat they're delicious 19 grams paired with a protein shake gets you like 45 to 50 grams of protein in a brownie and milk snack I keep some of these in my car put them in my gym bag my work bag so I always have a protein on the go option this company rocks they also give you ten dollars off your next order which I'm going to use for my third box because this box of 12 was forty dollars and now tick is giving coupons for 30 to 50% off plus free shipping these are a no-brainer for me everybody who I know who's ever tried them loves them I'm gonna link them below if you want to try them out yourself and check to see if you have that coupon free shipping
