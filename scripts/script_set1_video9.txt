yo please stop selling these out please cuz look how little I have and I keep missing their drops

2
0:00:07,000 --> 0:00:13,000
they've been doing better at keeping these stocked okay but I always go browsing at night

3
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and these are constantly being sold out especially on weekends so if you see this link right here and you want to try them 100% go get them right now before they sell out because it's a problem okay it's really getting to me because these are my favorite blue raspberry gushers

4
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I have tried so many and I know that these not might not be your favorite and some of the other ones that I have tried and maybe your favorite bees are my favorite because they are 100% blue raspberry okay and not only that but it is more of a powder base and the coat

5
0:00:50,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the coat on them is unmatched okay not only that but like the gushers themselves are very like they're not hard and they're not too squishy

6
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they're just so good okay they're fresh

7
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
this is a size down from like the pound

8
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:20,000
I don't even know the size okay I'm sorry but it's just whatever is below the pound

9
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I order the pound every single time

10
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but I just have this one left over the coat is amazing if you are more so like a powder base lover this is the one that you're gonna want

11
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:44,000
if you like sour but don't like it like way too much to where you could enjoy like this whole container without your tongue going completely Raw

12
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000

0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000

0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:14,000

18
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:20,000
