immediately I see a layered look to it so this is printed in a multicolor filament that changes as it goes that gives the dragon kind of like an Armory look to it like it's got gold armor on it I love the Earth Tone colors keep in mind that I grabbed this from a random box so this is something that you can get in order to get its 10 dollars right here in The Tick Tock shop this measures about 12 inches summer shorter summer longer just got to your homework we are ready for you to pick one up for yourself I love to see which one you got please put in the comment below which one you ordered it's an inexpensive way to get your hands on these dragons
